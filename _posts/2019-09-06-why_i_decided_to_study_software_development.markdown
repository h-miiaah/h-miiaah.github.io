Software development has been one of my interests for a few years. I started by reading theory about Java online and through videos online. Giving it a try I started to figure out that I was doing well in the subject and was able to catch the logic quickly. After reading through the oracle manual I tried other languages like C++ and Python. Figuring out that each language had its own use or even multiple uses I tried looking for courses to learn a bit more. That is when I found out about Solo Learn which teaches how to code. From there on I got certificates in Java, C++, Python, PHP, SQL, JavaScript, Ruby, HTML, CSS, and even jQuery. 
After that I decided to find an actual school that teaches how to code and then move on to work in the tech industry. Flatiron school was on the top of my list. Now having completed all the pre work for the development course I know way more than I previously did, even built some cool apps throughout the pre work, which was also nice. Itâ€™s interesting to see that you can create something and many people can be able to use it later on in the future. Having a lot of networking and social interactions with the other development student is wonderful because together we help each other if any of us needs a solution or explanation on anything. Having that said, I am glad to have chosen Flatiron school to continue studying to code and am looking forward to great results.
